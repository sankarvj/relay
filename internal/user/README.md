## How users flow works?

Start my free trail button in the UI (landing.html) will store the account name in the drafts table and send the invitation mail to the user. 
Once the link is clicked it will take the user to the signup page(signup.html) when he gives the basic info and click submit the account will be created based on the info provided in the draft.

So far,
1. Account created
2. Added the user as the Admin
3. Added the user item in the owner entity

## How member invite works?

When the member info submitted by the ADMIN user it will add the new member in the owner entity. An invitation email will be sent to his email address. When he clicks the link the user will be taken to the page which asks the basic info if that user is not logged in already and proceeds with the sign up process. But he is already added to some other account then the user will be added with the new account ID and will be allowed to proceed with the login with his choice of account.
